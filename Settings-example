# The bastion host can be installed with one of the following types.
# Fedora Server 35, CentOS 8, and RHEL 8.5 were tested.
# You must download the prefered ISO file and save it in a localion that the 'qemu' can access. For example, /var/lib/libvirt/images/ .
# Please, choose one pair of type and install ISO file:
#

# For a RHEL bastion host.

# The bastion host will act as a authoritative nameserver for CLUSTER_DOMAIN. However, for external names, like registry.redhat.com, 
# the DNS server must forward the request to another nameserver. If you are at home, your router is a good candidate. If unsure, the
# Google nameservers are good options (8.8.8.8; 8.8.4.4), or the opendns.org (208.67.222.222 ; 208.67.220.220).
